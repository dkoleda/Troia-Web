===========================================
Java client
===========================================

This document assumes that you know what Troia project is about and have already setup its server.

To use Troia service you must create a request with unique ID and service URL configured.
Then you must execute three steps :
 
- data upload
- algorithm execution (computeBlocking)
- results download

It is possible to download results before executing algorithm but that will result in 
an incomplete data, so you must be sure that you called *computeBlocking* function before 
downloading results.
