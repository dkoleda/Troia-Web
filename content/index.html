<h3>
    <strong>Project Troia</strong> provides the set of web-methods which could be 
    used for calculation and data storing.
</h3>

<p>
    Mechanical Turk and other &quot;micro-outsourcing&quot; platforms allow the easy
    collection of annotation data from a wide variety of onliner workers.
    Unfortunately, the results returned back from the workers are of imperfect
    quality: No worker is perfect and each worker commits different types of errors. 
    Some workers are nothing more than spammers doing minimal, if any, real work.
